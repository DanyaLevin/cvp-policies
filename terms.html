‚Ä¢ üí∏ All sales are final; no refunds except where the law requires.
‚Ä¢ üö´ Don‚Äôt copy, resell, share or misuse the extension.
‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è Extension is provided as-is; results may vary depending on the data you provide.</span>

1 ACCEPTANCE
By installing or using the extension you confirm that you are at least 18 years old and have read, understood and agree to these terms and to our privacy policy. If you do not agree, do not use the extension.

2 SERVICE
The extension helps you draft a tailored CV based on CV data you provide and the LinkedIn post you are currently looking at. It generates a .docx file with changes highlighted in yellow, so you can review and finalize it.

The extension uses AI to tailor the CV and maximize keyword alignment with the job post. In doing so, despite guardrails, it may insert statements that are incorrect or exaggerated. You are solely responsible for reviewing the generated text and removing anything you cannot confidently defend in an interview. By using the extension, you accept this and agree not to hold us liable for the accuracy of AI-generated content.

3 PURCHASES
‚Ä¢ Credits: Generating one CV requires one credit, purchasable via ExtGate. No free trial or subscription is offered.
‚Ä¢ Payments: All payments are processed by Stripe.
‚Ä¢ Refunds: All sales are final; we do not provide refunds, except where required by law.

4 SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS
We will exercise reasonable skill and care to keep the extension working. However:
‚Ä¢ Browser updates or upstream service interruptions may affect operation.

If functionality stops or degrades for these reasons, we will attempt to restore it but make no guarantee of success, timeliness or continued availability, and no refund or compensation is owed.

5 ACCEPTABLE USE
You must not:
‚Ä¢ Submit someone else‚Äôs data without their permission.
‚Ä¢ Use the extension in a way that violates applicable law.
‚Ä¢ Introduce malware or interfere with service-providing servers.

All code, graphics and text in the extension are our intellectual property or that of our licensors. We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the extension for personal, non-commercial purposes in a compatible browser. You may not copy, sell, reverse-engineer, or make derivative works of the extension.

7 WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
The extension is provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available‚Äù. To the maximum extent permitted by law we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

8 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the fullest extent permitted by law we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages, or for lost data, profits or opportunities.

9 TERMINATION

10 GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTES
These terms are governed by Swiss law. Before starting formal proceedings you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the issue informally. If you are an EU consumer, you may also use the EU Online Dispute Resolution platform.

11 CHANGES
We may revise these terms. If changes are material we will post the new version here and update the effective date. Continued use of the extension after a change takes effect signifies acceptance of the revised terms.
